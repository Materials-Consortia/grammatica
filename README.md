GRAMMATICA README
=================

Introduction
------------

Grammatica is a C# and Java parser generator (compiler compiler).
It reads a grammar file (in an EBNF format) and creates well-
commented and readable C# or Java source code for the parser. It
supports LL(k) grammars, automatic error recovery, readable error
messages and a clean separation between the grammar and the source
code.
